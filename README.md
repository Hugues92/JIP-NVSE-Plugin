This is an NVSE plugin that adds 200+ new functions which can be used in scripts, in the GECK. It is a compilation of various functions I had made over the past year, some for my own projects, some by request.

I am releasing it as a resource, should anyone find it useful/helpful. I may add new functions over time - requests/suggestions are welcome.

For a full list and documentation of the new functions, please visit this page: http://geck.bethsoft.com/index.php?title=Category:Functions_(JIP)
